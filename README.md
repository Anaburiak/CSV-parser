## Project Goals
- Practice working with real-world CSV data
- Build a full data pipeline using pure Python
- Understand data validation, cleaning, and analysis
- Generate automated analytical reports

## Dataset
- Source: Student Social Media & Relationships dataset
- Format: CSV
- Each row represents one student's anonymized survey response

## Pipeline Overview
1. Load CSV data into Python dictionaries
2. Validate structure and detect missing values
3. Clean and convert data types
4. Perform statistical analysis
5. Generate a formatted text report

## 🚀 Key Features
- CSV parsing using Python standard library
- Data validation and missing-value detection
- Safe type conversion with error handling
- Statistical analysis (averages, top-N values)
- Grouping by categorical fields (country)
- Automated report generation

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10+
- csv (standard library)
- collections (defaultdict)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed
3. Run:
   ```bash
   python main.py

## Project Status
This project was completed as a learning mini-project after the first month of my Machine Learning self-study plan.
The project was completed in several iterations, with correction of logical and analytical errors.

## Possible Improvements
- Refactor into multiple modules
- Add pandas-based implementation
- Add visualizations
- Extend to machine learning tasks
